# Elastic ShapeOpt
This is an adaptation of the DTU code [found here](https://www.topopt.mek.dtu.dk/Apps-and-software/Topology-optimization-codes-written-in-Python) for shape optimization. 
A simple example where a font is used to derive some boundary conditions for the optimization problem is show. The code is (and will be) in perpetual ``under construction'' mode since it's for interactive experimentation. The notebook contains everything: extraction of BCs from images, setting of boundary conditions for the elasticity problem, setting of constraints for the optimization problem and optimization with gradient descent. Enjoy!
